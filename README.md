# Introduction to Computer Science for Clinicians 2021

The purpose of this repository is to list some computer science learning modules by topic. This was initially created to index material for a 1 semester introduction to computer science course for clinical informatics students. This is designed to be a boot-camp type of experience with an introduction to Python and web programming. There is a heavy emphasis on small programming tasks.
